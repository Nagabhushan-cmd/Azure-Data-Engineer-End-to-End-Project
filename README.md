# Azure-Data-Engineer-End-to-End-Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline built using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**, **Azure Databricks**, **Azure Synapse Analytics**, and **Power BI**. The pipeline performs data ingestion, transformation, and loading across different layers in the data lake (Silver and Gold layers), with the final output used for reporting and analysis in Power BI.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2**
- **Azure Databricks**
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**
- **Power BI**

## Project Workflow
1. **Ingestion**:
   - **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** is used for orchestrating data pipelines and moving data from source systems to **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)** Gen2.

2. **Data Transformation (Silver Layer)**:
   - **Azure Databricks** is mounted to **ADLS Gen2** to process raw data into a transformed, clean format for the Silver layer.
   - Data transformation operations, including filtering, aggregation, and enrichment, are performed in Databricks notebooks.

3. **Data Storage (Gold Layer)**:
   - Processed data is loaded into the **Gold layer** in **ADLS Gen2** after transformation, which serves as the final, analytical dataset.

4. **Data Modeling with Azure Synapse**:
   - **Azure Synapse Analytics** is used to configure **views** and **external tables** to access the data from ADLS Gen2 for reporting purposes.
   - Data is loaded into Synapse for further processing and analysis.

5. **Power BI Integration**:
   - Data from the Gold layer is connected to **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and business intelligence analysis.

## How to Run the Project
1. Set up **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** for orchestration.
2. Mount **Azure Databricks** to **ADLS Gen2** for data transformation.
3. Configure **Azure Synapse Analytics** for querying and external table creation.
4. Set up **Power BI** to connect to the Gold layer for analysis and visualization.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites:
- An **Azure subscription** with permissions to create resources (ADF, ADLS, Synapse, Databricks).
- **Power BI** account for connecting to Synapse and viewing reports.

### Setup Instructions:
1. Create an **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** pipeline to orchestrate data ingestion into **ADLS Gen2**.
2. Mount **Azure Databricks** to **ADLS Gen2** and create notebooks for transforming the data into the Silver layer.
3. Set up **Azure Synapse Analytics** for querying data and creating external tables.
4. Load data into the **Gold layer** and configure **Power BI** to connect to Synapse for visualizations.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **real-time data processing** using **Azure Stream Analytics**.
- **Machine Learning** models in Databricks for predictive analytics.
- Automate monitoring and logging of data pipelines.
